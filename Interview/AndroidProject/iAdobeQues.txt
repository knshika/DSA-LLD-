6. Given two sorted lists, write a function to merge them into one sorted list.
This question evaluates your ability to manipulate lists and perform basic sorting operations in Python. It assesses your understanding of list manipulation and sorting algorithms, which are essential skills for a software engineer at Adobe.

Bonus: What’s the time complexity?

Example:

Input:

list1 = [1,2,5]

list2 = [2,4,6]
Output:

def merge_list(list1,list2) -> [1,2,2,4,5,6]
How to Answer

Begin by explaining the approach you would take to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list. Then, discuss the time complexity of your solution.

Example

“We will employ a technique with a time complexity of O(n1 + n2) and additional space usage of O(n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 denote the sizes of the lists being provided. The concept revolves around employing the merge function from merge sort.

We’ll start by creating an empty list and two indexes, i and j. We’ll use these indexes to traverse each array in a while loop by comparing each element against each other in the arrays.

For each loop, we’ll pick the smaller of the current elements in list1 and list2.”

def merge_list(list1, list2): 
    list3 = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
  
    # Traverse both lists
    # If the current element of first list
    # is smaller than the current element
    # of the second list, then store the
    # first list's value and increment the index 

    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2): 
      
        if list1[i] < list2[j]: 
            list3.append(list1[i])
            i = i + 1
        else: 
            list3.append(list2[j])
            j = j + 1
      
  
    # Store remaining elements of the first list
    while i < len(list1): 
        list3.append(list1[i])
        i = i + 1
  
    # Store remaining elements of the second list
    while j < len(list2): 
        list3.append(list2[j])
        j = j + 1

    return list3

7. You have an array of integers, nums of length n spanning 0 to n with one missing. Write a function missing_number that returns the missing number in the array.
The interviewer will evaluate your understanding of array manipulation and basic algorithms required to work as a Software Engineer at Adobe.

Example:

Input:

nums = [0,1,2,4,5]

missing_number(nums) -> 3
How to Answer

Describe your approach to finding the missing number in the array nums while maintaining O(n) complexity.

Example

We can pass in the array and create a set that will hold each value in the input array. Then we create a for loop that will span the range from 0 to n, and look to see if each number is in the set we just created. If it isn’t, we return the missing number.

def missing_number(nums):
    num_set = set(nums)
    n = len(nums) + 1
    for number in range(n):
        if number not in num_set:
            return number 
8. Given a string str, write a function perm_palindrome to determine whether there exists a permutation of str that is a palindrome.
Your understanding of string manipulation and algorithmic thinking will be assessed with this question. It evaluates your ability to design an efficient algorithm for Adobe to solve a specific problem related to string manipulation and palindrome detection.

Example:

Input:

str = 'cacerra'

def perm_palindrome(str) -> True
“cacerra” returns True since it can be rearranged to form “racecar” which is a palindrome.

How to Answer

Describe an approach to determine whether a permutation of the input string str can form a palindrome. The approach should have a time complexity requirement of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Example

“If we count up all the characters in our input string, at most one can have an odd count. That means that if we have more than one letter with an odd count, we can discount the string as not being a palindrome.”

def perm_palindrome(str):
    arr = [0] * 1000

    num_odds = 0
    for char in str:
        i = ord(char)
        arr[i] += 1

        if arr[i] % 2 != 0:
            num_odds += 1
        else:
            num_odds -= 1

    return num_odds <= 1
9. Given a dictionary with weights, write a function random_key that returns a key at random with a probability proportional to the weights.
The interviewer at Adobe will evaluate your understanding of probability and algorithmic thinking. It assesses your ability to design an algorithm that selects a key from a dictionary with a probability proportional to its weight.

Example 1:

Input:

weights = {'A': 1, 'B': 2}
Output:

random_key(weights) -> return A 1/3 of the time, B 2/3 of the time
Example 2:

Input:

weights = {'A': 1, 'B': 1}
Output:

random_key(weights) -> return A 1/2  of the time, B 1/2  of the time
How to Answer

Describe an approach to select a key from the input dictionary with a probability proportional to its weight. The approach should have a time complexity requirement of O(n), where n is the number of keys in the dictionary.

Example

import random

def random_key(weights):
    total_sum = sum(weights.values())
    random_num = random.uniform(0, total_sum)
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for key, weight in weights.items():
        cumulative_sum += weight
        if cumulative_sum >= random_num:
            return key

Test
weights = {'A': 1, 'B': 2}

print(random_key(weights))  # Output: 'B' with probability 2/3, 'A' with probability 1/3
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it iterates through the dictionary weights once to calculate the total sum of weights and select a random key.

10. Given a table of transactions and a table of users, write a query to determine if users tend to order more to their primary address versus other addresses.
This question evaluates your understanding of SQL queries, database schema design, and data analysis, which are required skills for a Software Engineer at Adobe.

shipping_address	VARCHAR
users table:

Columns	Type
id	INTEGER
name	VARCHAR
address	VARCHAR
Example Output:

home_address_percent	0.76
How to Answer

Describe an SQL query that retrieves the percentage of transactions ordered to users’ primary addresses compared to other addresses. The query should join the transactions table with the users table and calculate the percentage of transactions for each user that are ordered to their primary address.

Example

“To determine the percentage of transactions ordered to users’ primary addresses compared to other addresses, I would write a SQL query that joins the transactions table with the users table on the user_id column. Then, I would use a conditional aggregation to count the number of transactions ordered to the primary address and other addresses for each user. Finally, I would calculate the percentage of transactions for each user that are ordered to the primary address.”

SELECT
ROUND( 
SUM(CASE WHEN u.address = t.shipping_address THEN 1 END)
/ COUNT(t.id)
,2)  as home_address_percent
FROM transactions as t
JOIN users as u
ON t.user_id = u.id
