**Base**

**Why does an Android App lag?**
- Android apps can lag due to issues such as unoptimized code, poor memory management, excessive main thread operations, inefficient layouts, or large bitmap processing without proper handling. To avoid lag, developers should optimize memory use, offload heavy tasks to background threads, and use tools like `Lint` and `Profiler`.

**What is Context? How is it used?**
- Context in Android is an interface to global information about an application environment. It provides access to resources, application-level operations, and allows interaction with app components like databases, shared preferences, and more. For more details, refer to [Context in Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context).

**Tell all the Android application components.**
- Android application components include:
  1. **Activities**: UI components representing a single screen.
  2. **Services**: Background processes that can run for a long time.
  3. **Broadcast Receivers**: Components that respond to broadcast messages from other apps or the system.
  4. **Content Providers**: Manage access to structured data sets and facilitate data sharing between apps.

**What is the project structure of an Android Application?**
- An Android app project typically includes `src` (source code), `res` (resources like layouts, images, etc.), `AndroidManifest.xml` (application configuration), `build.gradle` (build configurations), and more.

**What is AndroidManifest.xml?**
- This XML file is essential as it declares all the components of the app and permissions needed. It acts as a bridge between the app and the Android operating system.

**What is the Application class?**
- The `Application` class is the base class within an Android app that holds all components like activities and services. It initializes before any other class in the app when the app's process is created. Subclassing `Application` allows for maintaining global application state.

**Activity and Fragment**

**Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a Fragment?**
- Using only the default constructor ensures that the fragment instance is retained properly during configuration changes (e.g., device rotation) by the FragmentManager. Avoid passing parameters through constructors as it can lead to unexpected behavior. Use `Bundle` for arguments instead.

**What is Activity and its lifecycle?**
- An `Activity` represents a single screen in an app. The lifecycle includes states like `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()`, and `onRestart()`. These callbacks help manage transitions and save states.

**What is the difference between onCreate() and onStart()?**
- `onCreate()` is called when the activity is first created and is used to initialize essential components. `onStart()` is called when the activity becomes visible to the user, preceding `onResume()`.

**When only onDestroy is called for an activity without onPause() and onStop()?**
- This happens if `finish()` is called within `onCreate()` or if the system forcibly destroys the activity without passing through `onPause()` and `onStop()`.

**Why do we need to call setContentView() in onCreate() of Activity class?**
- `setContentView()` is needed to define the UI layout for an activity. It inflates the XML layout and binds it to the activity.

**What is onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() in activity?**
- `onSaveInstanceState()` is used to save the activity's current state before it is paused or destroyed. `onRestoreInstanceState()` is called after `onStart()` if there is a saved state to recover, allowing the activity to restore UI and data state.

Continuing with the rest of the questions:

**What is Fragment and its lifecycle?**
- A `Fragment` is a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, layout, and can handle its own input events. The lifecycle includes states such as `onAttach()`, `onCreate()`, `onCreateView()`, `onActivityCreated()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroyView()`, `onDestroy()`, and `onDetach()`.

**What are "launchMode"?**
- `launchMode` is an attribute for activities that determines how they are launched in a task. The common modes include:
  1. **standard**: Default mode, multiple instances can exist.
  2. **singleTop**: If an instance exists at the top of the stack, no new instance is created.
  3. **singleTask**: A new task is created, and only one instance of the activity exists.
  4. **singleInstance**: The activity runs in its own task, with no other activities in the same task.

**What is the difference between a Fragment and an Activity? Explain the relationship between the two.**
- An `Activity` represents a full screen, while a `Fragment` represents a reusable portion of an activityâ€™s UI. Fragments depend on activities for their lifecycle and cannot exist without being hosted in an activity.

**When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?**
- Use `Fragment` when:
  - You need to display UI components that will be reused in different activities.
  - Multiple views need to be displayed side by side (e.g., ViewPager).
  - You want to create a more flexible and dynamic UI.

**What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter vs FragmentStatePagerAdapter?**
- **FragmentPagerAdapter**: Keeps the fragment instance in memory but destroys the view when it's not visible.
- **FragmentStatePagerAdapter**: Completely destroys the fragment instance and only retains the state, making it suitable for a larger number of fragments.

**What is the difference between adding/replacing a fragment in the back stack?**
- **Adding** a fragment to the back stack means that the current fragment is preserved and can be returned to when the user presses back.
- **Replacing** removes the current fragment and replaces it with a new one; the replaced fragment is not kept in the back stack unless explicitly added.

**How would you communicate between two Fragments?**
- Communication between fragments is typically done using the hosting activity as an intermediary or using a `ViewModel` with shared data.

**What is a retained Fragment?**
- A retained fragment is a fragment that is not destroyed and recreated during configuration changes. Setting `setRetainInstance(true)` helps maintain the fragment's state.

**What is the purpose of addToBackStack() while committing a fragment transaction?**
- `addToBackStack()` saves the fragment transaction so that it can be reversed by pressing the back button. This enables users to return to the previous fragment state.

**Views and ViewGroups**

**What is View in Android?**
- A `View` is a UI element such as a `Button`, `TextView`, or `EditText` that interacts with the user. It's a basic building block for user interface components.

**Difference between View.GONE and View.INVISIBLE?**
- `View.GONE` makes the view invisible and removes it from the layout, while `View.INVISIBLE` hides the view but still takes up space.

**Can you create a custom view? How?**
- Yes, custom views can be created by extending the `View` class and overriding methods like `onDraw()` and `onMeasure()` to define the view's appearance and behavior.

**What are ViewGroups and how are they different from Views?**
- A `ViewGroup` is a container that holds other `View` and `ViewGroup` elements. It is an invisible layout that organizes the layout structure. Examples include `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, and `ConstraintLayout`.

**What is a Canvas?**
- `Canvas` is a class used for drawing on a `View`. It provides methods for drawing shapes, text, and images onto the `View`.

**What is a SurfaceView?**
- `SurfaceView` is a view that provides a dedicated drawing surface embedded in the view hierarchy. It is commonly used for rendering graphics in a separate thread.

**Relative Layout vs Linear Layout**
- **RelativeLayout**: Positions child views relative to each other or to the parent.
- **LinearLayout**: Arranges child views in a single row or column.

**Tell about Constraint Layout**
- `ConstraintLayout` is a flexible layout that allows positioning of views relative to each other or to the parent layout, simplifying complex layouts and reducing nesting.

**Do you know what is the view tree? How can you optimize its depth?**
- A view tree represents the hierarchy of views in a layout. Optimizing its depth involves reducing nested layouts by using flat layouts like `ConstraintLayout` and optimizing with tools like `Layout Inspector`.

**Displaying Lists of Content**

**What is the difference between ListView and RecyclerView?**
- `RecyclerView` is more advanced and efficient than `ListView`, supporting features like ViewHolder patterns, item animations, and layout managers. `ListView` is simpler but less flexible.

**How does RecyclerView work internally?**
- `RecyclerView` uses a `LayoutManager` to determine item positioning and a `Recycler` to recycle views, avoiding creating new ones and boosting performance.

**How does RecyclerView improve performance over ListView?**
- `RecyclerView` reuses item views efficiently using the `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`, improving memory usage and scrolling performance.

**What are the components of a RecyclerView?**
- The main components are `Adapter`, `ViewHolder`, `LayoutManager`, and `ItemAnimator`.

**Explain the role of RecyclerView.Adapter and RecyclerView.ViewHolder**
- The `Adapter` connects the data source to the `RecyclerView`, binding data to the `ViewHolder`. The `ViewHolder` holds references to the views for each data item.

**What is a LayoutManager in RecyclerView?**
- `LayoutManager` is responsible for measuring and positioning item views in `RecyclerView`.

**How do you handle multiple view types in a single RecyclerView?**
- Override `getItemViewType()` in the `Adapter` to return different view types and create logic for binding each type in `onCreateViewHolder()` and `onBindViewHolder()`.

**What is DiffUtil and how does it improve RecyclerView performance?**
- `DiffUtil` is a utility that calculates the difference between two data sets and updates only the items that have changed, making `RecyclerView` updates more efficient.

**What is the purpose of RecyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true)?**
- It informs the `RecyclerView` that changes in content will not change the size of the `RecyclerView` itself, allowing optimizations.

**How do you update a specific item in RecyclerView?**
- Call `notifyItemChanged(position)` for a specific item update.

**What is SnapHelper?**
- `SnapHelper` helps `RecyclerView` snap items to a position within the scrolling, such as snapping to the center or start.

Let me know if you need answers to the remaining sections or any specific question explained in detail!

Continuing with the remaining sections:

### **Dialogs and Toasts**

**What is Dialog in Android?**
- A `Dialog` is a small window that prompts the user to make a decision or enter additional information. It does not fill the screen and is typically used for notifications or inputs.

**What is Toast in Android?**
- A `Toast` is a short message that is displayed on the screen and disappears after a certain amount of time. It is used to show feedback to the user without blocking user interaction.

**What is the difference between Dialog and DialogFragment?**
- **Dialog**: A traditional popup that can block the UI until the user interacts with it.
- **DialogFragment**: A fragment that displays a dialog window, allowing for better lifecycle management as it is tied to the `FragmentManager`.

### **Intents and Broadcasting**

**What is Intent?**
- An `Intent` is a messaging object used to request an action from another app component. It can start activities, services, or broadcast receivers.

**What is an Implicit Intent?**
- An `Implicit Intent` is used when you do not specify the exact component to handle the intent. The system resolves it to a suitable app (e.g., sharing an image).

**What is an Explicit Intent?**
- An `Explicit Intent` specifies the exact component (activity or service) to start. It is used within the same app when you know the class name of the component.

**What is a BroadcastReceiver?**
- A `BroadcastReceiver` is a component that listens for and responds to system-wide broadcast announcements (e.g., battery low, network status changes).

**What is a Sticky Intent?**
- A `Sticky Intent` is an intent that remains in the system after the broadcast has been completed so other receivers can retrieve that data. An example is `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED`.

**Describe how broadcasts and intents work to pass messages around your app.**
- Broadcasts can be sent and received within the app or across different apps using `sendBroadcast()` and `registerReceiver()`. Intents carry data between activities and services.

**What is a PendingIntent?**
- A `PendingIntent` is a token that another app or component can use to execute an `Intent` on behalf of your app, even if your app is not running.

**What are the different types of Broadcasts?**
- **Normal Broadcast**: Standard broadcasts using `sendBroadcast()`.
- **Ordered Broadcast**: Delivered to one receiver at a time using `sendOrderedBroadcast()`.
- **Sticky Broadcast**: Deprecated; stays around after being sent using `sendStickyBroadcast()`.

### **Services**

**What is a Service?**
- A `Service` is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without a user interface.

**Service vs IntentService**
- **Service**: Runs on the main thread and is ideal for tasks that don't require threading.
- **IntentService**: Runs in a background thread and handles asynchronous requests automatically.

**What is a Foreground Service?**
- A `Foreground Service` performs tasks that are noticeable to the user. It displays a notification and continues running even when the user is not interacting with the app.

**What is a JobScheduler?**
- `JobScheduler` is an API used to schedule background jobs based on conditions like network status or charging state.

### **Inter-process Communication**

**How can two distinct Android apps interact?**
- Apps can interact using Intents, `ContentProvider`, or through AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) for complex data types.

**Is it possible to run an Android app in multiple processes? How?**
- Yes, by setting the `android:process` attribute in the `AndroidManifest.xml` for components.

**What is AIDL? Enumerate the steps in creating a bounded service through AIDL.**
- AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) allows apps to communicate between processes.
  1. Define the `.aidl` file.
  2. Implement the generated interface.
  3. Expose it through a `Service`.
  4. Connect clients using `bindService()`.

**What can you use for background processing in Android?**
- Options include `WorkManager`, `JobScheduler`, `Service`, `IntentService`, and `Thread`.

**What is a ContentProvider and what is it typically used for?**
- A `ContentProvider` manages access to structured data (e.g., database or file). It is used to share data across applications.

### **Long-running Operations**

**How to run parallel tasks and get a callback when all are complete?**
- Use `Kotlin Coroutines` with `async` or `CompletableFuture` with `allOf()` in Java.

**What is ANR? How can ANR be prevented?**
- ANR (Application Not Responding) occurs when the main thread is blocked for too long. Prevent it by keeping long-running operations off the main thread using background tasks or worker threads.

**What is an AsyncTask (Deprecated in API level 30)?**
- `AsyncTask` is a background task handler to execute short operations on a background thread with results published on the main thread.

**What are the problems in AsyncTask?**
- Memory leaks due to holding references to `Activity`, difficulty in handling configuration changes, and lifecycle issues.

**Daemon Threads vs. User Threads**
- **Daemon Threads**: Run in the background and do not prevent the JVM from exiting.
- **User Threads**: Keep the JVM alive until they finish execution.

**Explain Looper, Handler, and HandlerThread.**
- **Looper**: Manages the message loop of a thread.
- **Handler**: Communicates with a `Looper` to send and process messages.
- **HandlerThread**: A `Thread` that includes a `Looper`, used for background tasks.

**Android Memory Leak and Garbage Collection**
- Memory leaks occur when references to unused objects are retained. `Garbage Collection` automatically reclaims unused memory, but developers must ensure references are released properly.

### **Working With Multimedia Content**

**How do you handle bitmaps in Android as it takes too much memory?**
- Use methods like `BitmapFactory.Options` for downsampling images and the `inSampleSize` attribute.

**Tell about the Bitmap pool.**
- A bitmap pool is a memory management technique to reuse bitmaps, reducing the cost of creation and garbage collection.

### **Data Saving**

- A modern, safe way to store key-value pairs or typed objects, replacing `SharedPreferences`.

**How to persist data in an Android app?**
- Options include `SharedPreferences`, `SQLite`, `Room`, `File storage`, `DataStore`, and `ContentProvider`.

**What is ORM? How does it work?**
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique to convert data between objects and databases, simplifying database operations.

**How would you preserve the Activity state during a screen rotation?**
- Use `onSaveInstanceState()` to save the state and restore it in `onCreate()` or `onRestoreInstanceState()`.

**What are different ways to store data in your Android app?**
- `SharedPreferences`, `File storage`, `SQLite`, `Room database`, `DataStore`, `ContentProvider`.

**Explain Scoped Storage in Android.**
- Scoped storage restricts apps' access to external storage, providing better security and privacy by isolating files within app-specific directories.

**How to encrypt data in Android?**
- Use libraries such as `Jetpack Security` for encrypted `SharedPreferences` or `Cipher` classes for file encryption.

**What is commit() and apply() in SharedPreferences?**
- `commit()`: Writes data synchronously and returns a success/failure boolean.
- `apply()`: Writes data asynchronously without a return value.

### **Look and Feel**

**What is a Spannable?**
- A `Spannable` is an interface for text with style spans applied over a portion of the text.

**What is a SpannableString?**
- `SpannableString` holds immutable text with mutable span information, used to style text dynamically.

**What are the best practices for using text in Android?**
- Use `String resources`, avoid hardcoded text, use `Spannable` for dynamic styling, and handle text direction.

**How to implement Dark mode in any application?**
- Define night-specific resource folders (`res/values-night`), use `AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()`, and adapt themes accordingly.

### **Memory Optimizations**

**What is the onTrimMemory() method?**
- A callback for an app to handle memory cleanup when the system is running low on resources.

**How to identify and fix OutOfMemory issues?**
- Use `Profiling tools`, reduce image sizes, use `BitmapFactory.Options`, and use LRU caches.

**How do you find memory leaks in Android applications?**
- Use tools like `Android Profiler`, `LeakCanary`, and analyze memory dumps with `MAT`.

### **Battery Life Optimizations**

**How to reduce battery usage in an Android application?**
- Use efficient algorithms, avoid excessive background work, use `JobScheduler`, `WorkManager`, optimize network calls, and reduce wake locks.

**What is Doze? What about App Standby?**
- **Doze**: Saves battery by deferring background CPU and network activity when the device is idle.
- **App Standby**: Restricts network and background processes for apps not recently used.

**What is overdraw?**
- Overdraw occurs when a pixel is drawn multiple times in a single frame. Reduce it by flattening layouts and minimizing overlapping views.

### **Supporting Different Screen Sizes**

**How do you support different types of resolutions?**
- Use `dp` and `sp` units, provide alternate layout resources (`res/layout-sw<N>dp

`), and test on different devices and screen sizes.

**What are the best practices for designing Android layouts for various screen sizes?**
- Use `ConstraintLayout`, scalable vector graphics, responsive UI, and design adaptive layouts.

Feel free to ask for detailed explanations or code examples on any specific topic!

Here are detailed explanations for the remaining sections you asked about:

### **Permissions**

**What are the different protection levels in permission?**
- **Normal**: Permissions that pose minimal risk to the user's privacy or operation of other apps. They are granted automatically.
- **Dangerous**: Permissions that could give the app access to private user data or control over the device. They require user approval.
- **Signature**: Permissions only granted if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app defining the permission.
- **SignatureOrSystem**: Restricted to apps in the system image or those signed with the same certificate as the app defining the permission.

### **Native Programming**

**What is the NDK and why is it useful?**
- The **NDK (Native Development Kit)** is a toolset that allows developers to write parts of their Android apps using C or C++ to achieve better performance. It is useful for computationally intensive tasks like game engines, complex algorithms, or code that needs to be shared across platforms.

**What is RenderScript?**
- **RenderScript** is a framework for parallel computing on Android. It is useful for high-performance computations, such as image processing or scientific computations. RenderScript has been deprecated and should now be replaced by other native solutions or GPU-based options.

### **Android System Internals**

**What is Android Runtime?**
- **Android Runtime (ART)** is the managed runtime used by newer versions of Android, replacing Dalvik. ART compiles the code to a native format at installation (AOT - Ahead of Time) and provides improvements in performance and efficiency.

**Dalvik, ART, JIT, and AOT in Android**
- **Dalvik**: The original runtime for Android that used Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- **ART**: The new runtime that uses Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, improving app startup time and memory usage.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time)**: Compiles parts of the code at runtime to increase performance.
- **AOT (Ahead-of-Time)**: Compiles the entire app during installation, reducing the runtime load.

**What are the differences between Dalvik and ART?**
- **Dalvik**:
  - Uses JIT compilation.
  - Bytecode is translated at runtime, leading to slower app launch times.
- **ART**:
  - Uses AOT and JIT (hybrid approach).
  - Pre-compiles bytecode, leading to faster app launches and better performance.
  - Improved garbage collection.

**What is DEX?**
- **DEX (Dalvik Executable)** is a format that Android apps are compiled to, containing the bytecode for the app to be executed by the ART or Dalvik runtime.

**What is Multidex in Android?**
- **Multidex** is the process of splitting an app's bytecode into multiple DEX files to overcome the 65,536 method reference limit in a single DEX file.

**Can you manually call the Garbage Collector?**
- Yes, you can call `System.gc()`, but it is not recommended because the garbage collector works best when managed by the system.

### **Android Jetpack**

**What is Android Jetpack and why use it?**
- **Android Jetpack** is a suite of libraries and tools designed to make Android app development easier, efficient, and robust. It covers four main categories: architecture, UI, foundation, and behavior, helping to solve common development challenges.

**What is a ViewModel and how is it useful?**
- A `ViewModel` is an architecture component that stores and manages UI-related data. It helps in surviving configuration changes like screen rotations, maintaining data consistency.

**What is SharedViewModel in Android?**
- A `SharedViewModel` is used for sharing data between different fragments in the same activity. This is done using the `ViewModelProvider` scoped to the activity.

**What are Android Architecture Components?**
- Components like `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, `Room`, `WorkManager`, and `Navigation` that help design robust, maintainable, and testable apps.

**What is LiveData in Android?**
- `LiveData` is a lifecycle-aware, observable data holder class. It only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

**How is LiveData different from ObservableField?**
- **LiveData** is lifecycle-aware and will only update observers that are active. `ObservableField` lacks this awareness and could trigger updates at any state.

**Difference between setValue and postValue in LiveData?**
- `setValue()` updates the value on the main thread.
- `postValue()` can be used to update the value from a background thread asynchronously.

**How to share ViewModel between Fragments in Android?**
- Use `ViewModelProvider(requireActivity()).get(SharedViewModel::class.java)` to create a `ViewModel` that is shared across multiple fragments.

**Explain WorkManager and its use cases.**
- `WorkManager` is a library for scheduling deferrable, asynchronous tasks that need guaranteed execution, like background data synchronization.

**How does ViewModel work internally?**
- It holds data and survives configuration changes by being associated with an `Activity` or `Fragment` lifecycle, ensuring data retention until the lifecycle is cleared.

### **Others**

**What is the difference between Serializable and Parcelable?**
- **Serializable** is a standard Java interface that is easier to implement but slower in performance due to reflection.
- **Parcelable** is Android-specific, more complex to implement, but faster and more efficient.

**Why is the Bundle class used for data passing?**
- `Bundle` is optimized for Android and works seamlessly with the Android lifecycle and inter-component communication.

**How do you troubleshoot a crashing application?**
- Check logs using `Logcat`, handle exceptions properly, use tools like `Firebase Crashlytics`, and review stack traces to identify the root cause.

**Explain the Android push notification system.**
- Push notifications are delivered through **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**, where the app registers for notifications and receives a unique token for the server to send messages.

**What is AAPT?**
- **AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool)** is used for packaging and building the Android APK. It processes resources and generates the `R.java` file.

**FlatBuffers vs JSON**

**How does Dagger work?**
- It generates code at compile-time to handle dependency injection by creating a dependency graph.

**Difference between Dagger 2 and Dagger-Hilt.**
- **Dagger 2** requires more boilerplate for setup, while **Dagger-Hilt** simplifies dependency injection with annotations and better integration with Android components.

**What is a Component in Dagger?**
- A **Component** is an interface that provides injected instances to parts of the app.

**What is Module in Dagger?**
- A **Module** provides the definitions for how dependencies should be constructed.

**How does custom scope work in Dagger?**
- Custom scopes define the lifecycle of dependencies, ensuring that they are shared across specific components or use cases.

**When to call dispose and clear on CompositeDisposable in RxJava?**
- **Dispose** releases the resources when the observer is no longer needed. `clear()` clears all disposables but keeps the `CompositeDisposable` instance reusable.

**What is Multipart Request in Networking?**
- A `Multipart Request` allows sending multiple data types (e.g., text, files) in a single HTTP request.

**What is Flow in Kotlin?**
- `Flow` is a cold asynchronous data stream that emits values sequentially.

**App Startup Library.**
- A Jetpack library that helps optimize app startup by initializing components in a defined order.

**Tell me something about RxJava.**
- **RxJava** is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for handling concurrency.

**How will you handle errors in RxJava?**
- Use `onErrorResumeNext()`, `onErrorReturn()`, or `retry()` operators.

**FlatMap vs Map Operator.**
- **Map** transforms each emitted item, while **FlatMap** flattens the resulting items into a single observable.

**Create vs fromCallable Operator in RxJava.**
- **Create** creates an observable from scratch, while `fromCallable` emits the result of a function.

**Defer operator in RxJava.**
- Creates a fresh observable each time a new observer subscribes, delaying the creation of the actual observable until subscription.

**Timer, Delay, and Interval Operators in RxJava.**
- **Timer** emits once after a specified delay, **Delay** postpones emissions

, and **Interval** emits at regular intervals.

**Making network calls in parallel using RxJava.**
- Use the `zip()` or `flatMap()` operators to execute and combine multiple observables in parallel.

**Difference between Concat and Merge.**
- **Concat** preserves the order and waits for each observable to complete. **Merge** interleaves emissions without waiting.

**Explain Subject in RxJava.**
- A **Subject** is both an observer and an observable that can emit items to multiple subscribers.

**Types of Observables in RxJava.**
- **Observable**, **Flowable**, **Single**, **Maybe**, and **Completable**.

**Implementing a search feature using RxJava.**
- Use operators like `debounce()`, `switchMap()`, and `distinctUntilChanged()` for instant search.

**Pagination in RecyclerView using RxJava.**
- Implement with operators like `concatMap()` and handle loading more data based on scroll position.

**How Glide and Fresco work.**
- They load images asynchronously, manage memory with caching, and handle image transformations and placeholders efficiently.

**Schedulers.io() vs Schedulers.computation() in RxJava.**
- **Schedulers.io()** is for I/O-bound tasks like networking. **Schedulers.computation()** is for CPU-bound operations like calculations.

Here are answers to the topics related to Android architecture, system design, unit testing, and tools:

### **Android Architecture**

**Describe the architecture of your last app.**
- The app followed the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to separate concerns and improve testability. The data layer used `Repository` patterns to interact with local and remote data sources, and `LiveData` or `Flow` was employed for reactive updates. The presentation logic was handled by `ViewModel` classes, and `View` components were responsible for UI rendering. Dependency injection with Dagger-Hilt streamlined the dependency management.

**Describe MVVM.**
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** is an architectural pattern that helps to separate the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic. The **View** displays data and forwards user interactions to the **ViewModel**, which holds and processes data through **LiveData** or **StateFlow**. The **Model** represents the data source.

**MVC vs MVP vs MVVM architecture.**
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: The **Controller** handles user input, updates the **Model**, and refreshes the **View**. Tight coupling between **View** and **Controller**.
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**: The **Presenter** acts as a middle layer between the **View** and **Model**, with the **View** being more passive.
- **MVVM**: The **ViewModel** manages UI-related data with better separation of concerns and allows data-binding for automated UI updates.

**Clean Architecture**
- **Clean Architecture** focuses on separating the code into multiple layers: **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data**. This separation provides independence between frameworks, UI, and business logic, promoting testability and maintainability.

**Software Architecture vs Software Design**
- **Software Architecture**: The high-level structure defining components, their interactions, and guidelines.
- **Software Design**: More detailed, addressing how the individual components are implemented within the architecture.

  - **Memory and disk caching mechanisms**
  - **Eviction policies** and cache synchronization.

**Design an offline-first app**
- Use **local database** (e.g., Room or SQLite)
- Implement **data synchronization strategies**
- Use **WorkManager** for deferred updates.

**Design LRU Cache**
- A data structure that removes the **Least Recently Used** item when it reaches capacity. Typically implemented with a **LinkedHashMap** for efficient get and remove operations.

**Design Analytics Library**
- Track user interactions and events
- **Batch data processing** for network efficiency
- **Data storage** for offline use.

**HTTP Request vs HTTP Long-Polling vs WebSockets**
- **HTTP Request**: Traditional request-response model.
- **HTTP Long-Polling**: Client holds the request open until new data is available.
- **WebSockets**: Full-duplex communication for real-time data exchange.

**Voice and Video Call Work**
- Use **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication and media transmission.

**Design Uber App**
- Key components:
  - **Real-time location tracking**
  - **Routing and navigation services**
  - **Notifications** for driver/rider updates
  - **Backend with microservices**.

**Database Normalization vs Denormalization**
- **Normalization** reduces redundancy by organizing data.
- **Denormalization** combines tables to reduce join operations, increasing query performance.

**Hash vs Encrypt vs Encode**
- **Hashing**: One-way transformation for data integrity checks.
- **Encryption**: Two-way, reversible with a key, used for secure data transmission.
- **Encoding**: Transforming data into a format for compatibility, not for security.

### **Android Unit Testing**

**Unit Testing ViewModel with Kotlin Coroutines and LiveData**
- Use `TestCoroutineDispatcher` to test `LiveData` updates from coroutines.

**Unit Testing ViewModel with Kotlin Flow and StateFlow**
- Use `Turbine` for testing `Flow` emissions.

**What is Espresso?**
- A tool for **UI testing** in Android that allows for writing reliable tests for app interactions.

**What is Robolectric?**
- A testing framework that runs Android tests in the **JVM**, making them faster than on-device testing.

**Disadvantages of using Robolectric**
- Limited access to native components and slower than local unit tests.

**What is UI-Automator?**
- A framework for **cross-app UI testing**.

**Explain the unit test.**
- Tests **individual components** for correctness without external dependencies.

**Explain instrumented test.**
- Runs on **real devices or emulators** and interacts with the Android framework.

**Why Mockito is used?**
- For creating **mock objects** to isolate units of code for testing.

**Describe code coverage.**
- Measures the percentage of code executed during testing to identify untested parts.

### **Android Tools and Technologies**

**What is ADB?**
- **Android Debug Bridge**: A command-line tool for communicating with and managing Android devices.

**What is StrictMode?**
- A tool that detects accidental or bad practices in code, like network operations on the main thread.

**What is Lint?**
- Analyzes code for **potential errors and improvements**.

**Git**
- A version control system for tracking code changes.

**Firebase**
- A platform offering **backend services**, including authentication, database, and cloud messaging.

**Measuring method execution time**
- Use `System.nanoTime()` or `System.currentTimeMillis()` to measure execution.

**Access SQLite Database for debugging**
- Use **Android Device Monitor** or **Stetho** for database inspection.

**Things to consider with Proguard**
- Carefully configure the **Proguard rules** to avoid breaking functionality.

**Using Android Studio Memory Profiler**
- Tool for **monitoring memory usage**, detecting leaks, and optimizing app performance.

**What is Gradle?**
- A build tool for managing project dependencies and build configurations.

**APK Size Reduction**
- Use Proguard, resource shrinking, and vector drawables to reduce size.

**Speeding up Gradle builds**
- Use **Gradle daemon**, **parallel builds**, and configure **caching**.

**Multiple APKs for an Android app**
- Allows different APKs for various screen sizes or device types.

**ProGuard**
- Used for **code obfuscation, minification**, and optimization.

**Obfuscation vs Minification**
- **Obfuscation**: Makes code harder to read. **Minification**: Reduces code size by removing unused code.

**Changing app parameters without an update**
- Use **remote config** services like Firebase Remote Config.

**Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**
- Used for **improving database write performance** and data integrity by recording changes before applying them.
